# World_Weather_Analysis

##Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to build an API model that would generate an optimal list of cities with the user's ideal vacation weather. It would generate the weather conditions, temperature, latitude and longitude & also provide directions. I was able to do a roadtrip with directions in four different cities in mexico since I have always wanted to visit.

This image shows the roadtrip in the four different cities in Mexico. 

I was able to generate 328 different optimal cities based on the temperature being a low of 65 and a high of 85. With this information I chose Mexico as my point to do a roadtrip and was able to get google APIs, Places APIs & Directions API's to generate all of the weather status and directions status.
